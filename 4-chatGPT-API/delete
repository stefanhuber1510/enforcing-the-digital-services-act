19,"Happy National Coming out Day!! I’m Neon Binary! (Non-Binary Gender Neutral Elephant Human Hybrid Queen) Everyone’s journey is different. As a community we have to find positivity and strength in each other. Everyone has a story and everyone’s story is a tough journey: remember today to be proud of who you and your spectrum brothers and sisters are. Also, a huge thank you to the chosen family and allies that hold our hands as we take the journey into the world. Praying for a time when closet doors do not exist. I wanna take a moment and mention all the people that don’t have the freedom to be and express their true self. Many countries, laws, and fears hold our people back. Today I see you, I love you and I’m proud to have you as family.
