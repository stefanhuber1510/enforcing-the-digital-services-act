You can take it slow and at your own pace with an outdoor walk, hike or run. You can also prepare by stocking up on your favorite supplements. One of mine is my @1stPhorm apple juice flavored BCAA I like to sip throughout my workouts. Helps with recovery from workouts and muscle growth.

Fast forward through 2015-2016 when I added high intensity Squatting to the mix, my legs started looking ridiculous - scroll back if you care to see. The thing is, through my high volume squatting period, as these started disappearing again, that\u2019s the exact moment a lot of those little \u2018niggles\u2019 started to accrue out of nowhere. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nIf there is one Lower body programming tip I could give you - for size, strength and mobility - it\u2019s to prioritise these.
