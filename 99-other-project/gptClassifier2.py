# Note: gpt-3.5 by default tends to avoid the label 'sponsored'. That's why the prompt emphasises a strong emphasis in favor of it. I suspect this is due to this truthfulness fine-tuning, making it afraid to unjustly judge someone's post

standard_message = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant helping an academic to reason about whether a post contains (potentially non-commerical) promotional activity or even is potentially sponsored. I will provide you with the caption of an instagram post. You give me a short and concise reasoning why or why not the post might be an ad, i.e. the result of a financial contract. For later classification there are four labels available, 'Potentially sponsored', 'Self advertisement', 'Ambiguous' and 'Likely not sponsored'. Be concise in your reasoning and always strictly adhere to the pattern from the examples, i.e. always decide for one and only one label and finish your response with it. Err strongly towards 'Potentially sponsored', the slightest indication of potential sponsoring is sufficient to return 'Potentially sponsored'. Also strongly prefer 'Self advertisement' over 'Ambigous'. Always keep responses short and concise."},

However it is also extremely common that people feature restaurants because they genuinely enjoy their food or want to show off with it.
