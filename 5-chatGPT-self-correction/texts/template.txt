I will provide you with the caption of an instagram post. Return 'True.' if you think that the post to which it belongs contains (potentially undisclosed) promotional activity or ads, return 'False' if you think that it probably doesn't. Additionally you can return 'True/Uncertain.' or 'False/Uncertain.' if you are very uncertain about the decision, but especially for 'False.' prefer the stronger label. Before doing so, briefly outline your thought process why you think it contains ads or not, but be concise. Anyways, do not return anything else than the reasoning followed by one of the four labels 'True.', 'True/Uncertain.', 'False/Uncertain.' or 'False.'. If you are uncertain tend to err towards 'False.' Be concise with the thought. Strictly adhere to this pattern.
