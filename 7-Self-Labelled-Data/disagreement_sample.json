The ability to stay calm, controlled, and balanced is an essential skill overshadowed by the constant vigilance and observation of the shifting tides. To the master, any line taken can be conquered, but the river itself can never be tamed. I’ve learned, during my time as a martial artist, the best way to deal with anything moving, anything in constant flux, anything coming directly toward you or even at a multitude of angles, is to go with the flow. Resistance  is the enemy, calm synergy is the the way to victory. The river teaches us many things, some of them dangerous, others swift reminders to stay acute, but most important, deal with aggressive force with a calm resolve - Yin and Yang. #riverrun #kernriver #kayaklife #whitewaterkayaking #riverrapids #jacksonkayaks #sendit #paddlesports #paddlehard @aquabound @jackson.kayak @astralfootwear @sweetprotection",
